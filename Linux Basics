1)  # Kill a program in python
Suppose a program is frozen/hanged in ubuntu, Type "top" in the terminal, then look at the PID of the program that is hanged,
then write "kill PID No." and it will kill that program.

2)  # Uninstall a program, install a program and download a software from a site in command line. 
    rm -rf ~/anaconda2
    bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3.sh  # Here Anaconda is located in Downloads folder
    wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh   #It will directly download from the site
